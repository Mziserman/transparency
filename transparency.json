         "excerpt":"Europe has seen a surge in recent years of support for populist and nationalist movements – from Spain to the UK to Turkey. The reasons are manifold and complex, but are driven to a large degree by the belief that traditional democratic institutions – governments, political parties – are failing to deliver on promises of prosperity and equal opportunity and that they cannot be trusted. Corruption is central to this story – both the failure of governments to properly address corruption and their complicity in corrupt or clientelist schemes. It has become impossible to ignore systemic corruption in the way business influences politics, as shown by the on-going trial of 37 executives and politicians in Spain who are alleged to have been involved in a “kickbacks-for-contracts” scheme for nearly a decade.ii Examples such as this can give ordinary citizens the impression that public spending and public policy is distorted to favour the few over the many.",

         "excerpt":"Corruption and inequality feed off each other, creating a vicious circle between corruption, unequal distribution of power in society, and unequal distribution of wealth. As the Panama Papers showed, it is still far too easy for the rich and powerful to exploit the opaqueness of the global financial system to enrich themselves at the expense of the public good. Based on expert opinion from around the world, the Corruption Perceptions Index measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption worldwide. The findings are less than encouraging. Not a single country comes close to top marks, while over 120 countries score below 50 on the scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). This means less than a third of countries are even above the midpoint. Corruption hurts all countries. In our index’s lower-scoring countries, people frequently face situations of bribery and extortion, rely on basic services that have been undermined by the misappropriation of funds, and confront official indifference when seeking redress from authorities that are on the take. In higher-scoring countries the situation may seem less obvious in the daily lives of citizens, but closed-door deals, illicit finance, and patchy law enforcement exacerbate many forms of corruption at home and abroad. “We do not have the luxury of time,” says Ugaz. “Corruption needs to be fought with urgency, so that the lives of people across the world improve”.",

In its mapping of corruption risks, the study both describes perceived risks, as perceived by the stakeholders consulted, as well as specific examples of corruption. It also captures many of the good-practice mitigation measures being utilised. It was not, however, an investigation of any individual agency or group of agencies; nor does it attempt to quantify or estimate the overall percentage of losses due to corruption.",

The report is part of a series on corporate reporting published by Transparency International since 2008. Initially focused on the world’s top multinationals, the series was expanded to include a first report on emerging market multinationals in 2013. To enhance comparability, the company sample for this report is primarily based on the 2013 edition of the Transparency in Corporate Reporting: Assessing Emerging Market Multinationals report. This report assesses the public disclosure practices of emerging market multinationals based on three dimensions: first, the reporting of key elements of their anti-corruption programmes; second, the disclosure of their company structures and holdings; and, third, the disclosure of key financial information on a country-by-country basis. This information was gathered from corporate websites and other publicly available sources by a team of Transparency International researchers.",

         "excerpt":"This is the tenth annual progress report on OECD Anti-Bribery Convention enforcement by Transparency International, the global coalition against corruption. The OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, adopted in 1997, requires each signatory country to make foreign bribery a crime for which individuals and enterprises are responsible. The Convention is a key instrument for curbing the export of corruption globally because the 41 signatory countries are responsible for approximately two-thirds of world exports and almost 90 per cent of total foreign direct investment outflows. The OECD Working Group on Bribery, which represents the 41 Parties to the Convention, conducts a follow-up monitoring programme under which 9-10 countries are reviewed each year. Transparency International’s annual report on foreign bribery enforcement presents an independent assessment on the status of enforcement in all of the Parties to the Convention with the exception of Latvia, where the Convention entered into force only in 2014. In our methodology section we address the differences between our methodology and that of the OECD Working Group on Bribery.

         "excerpt":"In the past decades, Latin America has seen an explosion of government social spending targeting human development for the region’s poorest citizens. Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programmes, which link cash payments to the provision of education and health care, have been widely adopted. Given that these programmes are targeting families living in extreme conditions of vulnerability, it is essential that they are designed and implemented in a way that ensures that the programme funds get to the right people, for the right purposes and at the right time, free of political abuse or corruption. Unfortunately, as our regional report indicates, these social programmes can sometimes lack effective transparency, accountability and participation mechanisms. At best, this can lead to lack of understanding about benefit delivery and conditions, and a programme that is less responsive to the actual needs of intended beneficiaries. At worst, can mean the abuse of power for political or private gain by politicians and other programme stakeholders, culminating in extortion, clientelism, or the loss of benefits by those most in need. This report provides a set of evidence-based findings regarding common weaknesses found in the integrity mechanisms of selected CCT programmes in Latin America along with several recommendations for ensuring that programmes in the future operate with the most effective standards of transparency and accountability, especially accountability to those most in need – the intended beneficiaries.",

Their goal was to provide an accessible public procurement solution to reduce corruption in public procurement in Ukraine. The ProZorro platform was established on a pro bono basis and it was co-developed by a diverse group of stakeholders – including Transparency International Ukraine, the private sector and government champions. The ProZorro platform was launched and started piloting electronic bidding in February 2015. This case study seeks to assess how the multi-stakeholder co-creation approach affected the design and/or outcome of the e-procurement platform. In order to answer this question we conducted 17 in-depth interviews with activists, politicians, representatives of businesses and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), experts and software developers, all of whom actively participated in the creation of the new procurement system.",

President Ghani and his ministers, donors, civil society and leading organisations to assess the National Integrity System of Afghanistan. These recommendations aim to inform the Afghan Government and international community about their commitments regarding how to move the governance agenda forward at the Brussels Conference.

Few imagined international anti-corruption laws, corrupt dictators brought to justice, companies held to account, or individual citizens making the difference. We’ve proved all of this possible. And with our partners and supporters around the world, we will continue turning our vision into reality.",

The assessment reviewed the Fund’s governance design and transparency, accountability, and integrity policies and procedures with a view to identifying and promoting best practice models for climate finance. The Assessment recognised a number of best practices exhibited by the Adaptation Fund, including its direct access, fiduciary, access to information and public participation policies. It also recommended areas where the Fund’s policies and practices could be strengthened. This Progress Report follows-up on those recommendations to recognise progress achieved by the Fund’s Board and Secretariat. Additionally, it includes an assessment and rating of three new indicators regarding the Fund’s access to information, anti-money laundering and procurement safeguards policies and practices.",

         "excerpt":"The real estate market has long provided a way for individuals to secretly launder or invest stolen money and other illicitly gained funds. Not only do expensive apartments in New York, London or Paris raise the social status of their owners and enhance their luxurious lifestyles, but they are also an easy and convenient place to hide hundreds of millions of dollars from criminal investigators, tax authorities or others tracking criminal behaviour and the proceeds of crime. In many such cases, property is purchased through anonymous shell companies or trusts without undergoing proper due diligence by the professionals involved in the deal. The ease with which such anonymous companies or trusts can acquire property and launder money is directly related to the insufficient rules and enforcement practices in attractive markets. The countries analysed in this study – Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States – have committed in different forums, such as through the FATF and the Group of 20 (G20), to do more to prevent and curb money laundering and terrorist-financing, including by regulating gatekeepers, such as real estate agents, lawyers and accountants, who may act as facilitators in transactions that can enable money laundering. This report identifies the main problems related to real estate and money laundering in these four countries and finds that, despite international commitments, current rules and practices are inadequate to mitigate the risks and detect money laundering in the real estate sector.",

         "excerpt":"Recognising the role of whistleblowing in corruption-fighting efforts, many countries have pledged to enact whistleblower protection laws through international conventions. And, ever more governments, corporations and non-profit organisations around the world are putting whistleblower procedures in place. It is essential, however, that these policies provide accessible disclosure channels for whistleblowers, meaningfully protect whistleblowers from all forms of retaliation, and ensure that the information they disclose can be used to advance needed reforms. To help ensure that whistleblowers are afforded proper protection and disclosure opportunities, the principles presented here serve as guidance for formulating new and improving existing whistleblower legislation. They should be adapted to an individual country’s political, social and cultural contexts, and to its existing legal frameworks. They take into account lessons learned from existing laws and their implementation in practice, and have been shaped by input from whistleblower experts, government officials, academia, research institutes and NGOs from all regions. These principles will be updated and refined as experiences with legislation and practices continue to unfold.",

The corrupt often turn to banks and other financial institutions to legitimise their monies, bringing them into the formal financial system. Financial institutions can prevent these flows from ever entering the system. They can do this by effectively identifying perspective investors and clients as “Politically Exposed Persons” (PEPs): individuals who have held or are in public office. By flagging potential PEPs, banks are then able to do additional checks on the source of funds and to ensure that they are free of corruption.",

The primary aim of the assessment is therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of Vanuatu’s institutions in preventing and fighting corruption and in fostering transparency and integrity. In addition, it seeks to promote the assessment process as a springboard for action among the government and anti-corruption community in terms of policy reform, evidence-based advocacy or further in-depth evaluations of specific governance issues. This assessment should serve as a basis for key stakeholders in Vanuatu to advocate for sustainable and effective reform.",

         "excerpt":"Corruption and poor governance are acknowledged as major impediments to realising the right to education and to reaching global development goals. Corruption not only distorts access to education, but affects the quality of education and the reliability of research findings. From corruption in the procurement of school resources and nepotism in the hiring of teachers, to the buying and selling of academic titles and the skewing of research results, major corruption risks can be identified at every level of the education and research systems. At the same time, education serves as a means to strengthen personal integrity and is a critical tool to address corruption effectively. The Global Corruption Report is Transparency International’s flagship publication, bringing the expertise of the anti-corruption movement to bear on a specific corruption issue or sector. The Global Corruption Report: Education consists of more than 70 articles commissioned from experts in the field of corruption and education, from universities, think tanks, business, civil society and international organisations.

The first report was issued in March 2005, covering 24 countries; the second in June 2006, covering 31 countries. TI's progress reports are intended to provide an annual assessment of government enforcement. Enforcement of the OECD Convention is crucially important to the fight against international corruption. Most major multinational companies have their headquarters in signatory states and effective enforcement would significantly reduce the supply side of international corruption.",

The OECD Working Group on Bribery also publishes data on enforcement by the Parties in its annual reports. Results of the two reports are basically similar – both indicate that in half of the countries there is little or no enforcement against foreign bribery and show that Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States have the most active enforcement.",

Such considerations can lead to better designed and targeted policies to combat corruption. They can also create the space for civil society to become engaged and carry out more effective corruption monitoring, which contributes to improvements in policy formulation. However, research findings on the subject have varied over the years and there is still no clear consensus about the inter- relationship between gender and corruption. This paper will explore recent evidence on the topic in an attempt to determine whether and how women have an impact on — and are affected by — corruption.",

         "excerpt":"Financial systems depend on trust from citizens and businesses to function. A vital part of this trust is the belief that banks are not holding funds on behalf of corrupt individuals and organisations, criminals, or terrorists. In recent years, the financial sector has provided ample reason to question this belief. The majority of large-scale corruption scandals, from Ukraine to Brazil, have featured banks transferring or managing funds for the perpetrators and their associates. To reduce money-laundering risks and increase the systemic accountability of the financial sector, this report recommends that financial sector supervisors should make a standard set of supervisory and enforcement statistics public on a yearly basis, including the number of banks inspected, the number of regulatory breaches found, and the number and value of sanctions imposed. The report’s findings show that currently just 1 in 3 such statistics is publicly available across the 12 countries assessed. Regular data on anti-money laundering supervision would allow for greater oversight by citizens, media, and national and international authorities.",

From fixing the gaps in international standards and national legislation to increasing the number of suspicious reports being submitted to authorities by luxury sector businesses, much remains to be done to reduce the scope for individuals using the proceeds of corruption to acquire and enjoy high-value goods and property, and to use these assets as a vehicle for laundering their ill-gotten gains.",

Although the immediate prospects for peace in the country remain unclear, what is certain is that long-term stability cannot be secured unless a sustained effort is made to tackle corruption. Experience from post-conflict countries around the world shows that widespread corruption undermines the authority of the state and its institutions and provides fertile ground for criminal networks to develop and insurgents to operate. Corruption also deprives the poor and vulnerable of essential services and limits their access to justice. By weakening the bonds of trust between citizens and the state, it heightens the risk of conflict re-emerging.",

         "excerpt":"For Transparency International the London Anti-Corruption Summit, taking place on May 12, 2016, provides a unique opportunity for global leaders to adopt concrete, ambitious commitments that can be implemented over the next five years. This briefing sets out just some of the most important specific actions and agreements that are needed for the Summit to be a success. The Summit is also expected to put forward additional initiatives that may help ensure that a comprehensive approach is taken to tackling corruption. At the very least, the summit must deliver on: preventing corruption ending impunity for those who benefit from corrupt acts and empowering and supporting citizens to report corruption World leaders must guarantee the commitments will be implemented over a defined period of time and that progress (or the lack of it) will be monitored. Once the dust has settled, global leaders cannot be allowed to walk away with yet another lofty communique of high principled intent and no game plan for implementation. A key prerequisite for a successful Summit is that the host Government of the United Kingdom (UK) gets its own house in order to ensure credibility on the global stage. The UK has many challenges with domestic corruption to address, including risks identified in areas such as political funding, peer appointments, police corruption, procurement and local government. The UK should also require its own Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, which host hundreds of thousands of secret companies and legal entities, to publish time-bound plans of action for publishing registries that show the names of the real people – beneficial owners – of the companies and legal entities incorporated there.",

It equips young citizens with the knowledge and skills to thrive in their country's economy and to participate fully in society. It is a cornerstone of economic and social development, a human right under international law and a constitutional guarantee in most countries. But in reality education is often characterised by poor quality and unequal access. For example, a region-wide survey of Africa’s education system showed more than 50 percent of respondents signalling numerous challenges to getting a basic education. Classroom overcrowding, poorly maintained primary schools, absent teachers, lack of textbooks and supplies, and unacceptably high fees and expenses were just some of the problems cited. When it comes to higher education, access in many countries depends more on the parents' purse and social status than the talent, effort and merit of the student. Unfortunately, corruption tends to be one of the principal reasons behind all these problems.",

         "excerpt":"‘Defence is the last refuge of grand corruption’, said John Githongo, Kenya’s former permanent secretary for governance, in 2006. The defence establishment has historically been one of the least open of any government organisation — to public or even intra-governmental scrutiny. The secrecy that necessarily veils some defence activities often extends more widely than can be justified, leaving the sector with little oversight and vulnerable to corruption. As with any form of corruption, abuses of power in the defence sector are not a victimless crime. Every dollar misappropriated represents a waste of resources and creates a more dangerous — and less trustworthy — security environment for all.",

Many of these countries have made legislative amendments to harmonise their national laws with the requirements of the convention, and some of them have drawn up strategic plans to fight corruption. The Arab Anti-Corruption and Integrity Network (ACINET) was established to coordinate the efforts of the integrity and anti-corruption bodies in Arab countries. Recently, no less than four Arab countries have undergone a review of the extent of their adherence to the convention. Despite these achievements, the results on the ground in the field of strengthening integrity and fighting corruption in the Arab region are still modest compared to other regions of the world.",

It represented the midway point on the road to meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the ambitious global pledge to end extreme poverty by 2015. It also signalled that ten years had passed since the anti- corruption movement had signed the Lima Declaration, promising to address poverty as part of their efforts. However, actual accomplishments have fallen short of expected progress. In practice, donors and governments still treat poverty and corruption as separate — rather than integral — components of the same strategy. The continued lack of policy integration has undermined efforts to fight both poverty and corruption. Poverty continues to plague more than a half of the world’s citizens, with nearly three billion people living on less than two dollars-a-day. Data on the MDGs show the current development trend not keeping pace with earlier projections. Bottlenecks have developed in certain regions and key countries, creating sizable challenges to meeting the 2015 timeline.",

         "excerpt":"The terms and conditions under which judges and court officials work are important in determining their likelihood to engage in corrupt practice. Judiciaries faced with low salaries, poor training and benefits, uncertain security of tenure, or sub-standard administration are unlikely to attract and retain high-quality candidates. Even where able judges and court staff are in place, poor terms and conditions can provide both incentives and opportunities for resorting to corruption. The security of tenure is an essential means of securing judicial independence but, more broadly, conditions of service should provide a professional environment that is a transparent, motivating and safe place for judicial officers to work. Developing decent working environments is therefore a key means of preventing judicial corruption.",

Transparency also bolsters judicial independence. A diligent judge, for example, can demonstrate that they are acting in accordance with the law.

Two problems are analysed: political interference to pressure judges for rulings in favour of political or economic interests, including in corruption cases; and petty bribery involving court personnel. The result is a thorough analysis of how judicial independence and judicial accountability, two concepts key to the promotion of judicial integrity, can be bolstered to tackle corruption in judicial systems.",

It contributes to water scarcity, large- scale pollution and the destruction of natural habitats — all factors which make our response to climate change more difficult. If present patterns continue, climate change is expected to fundamentally alter rainfall and river flows, drive up sea levels and put water supplies at risk in many regions. The world will see more frequent and catastrophic storms, floods and droughts with incalculable human consequences. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has already warned that the world’s poorest are going to bear the greatest burden from these shifts. They estimate that more than US $86 billion will be needed annually — for environmental infrastructure and social protection schemes — to overcome the rising inequality unleashed by climate change.",

         "excerpt":"Where political power plays a significant role in the appointment, promotion and conditions of service of judges there is a risk that judicial candidates, as well as sitting judges, will feel compelled to respond positively to the demands of the powerful. In some countries, judges who abide by the wishes of senior public officials may be rewarded with modern office equipment, higher quality housing or newer cars. Rather than act as a check on government or economic interests in protecting civil liberties and human rights, judges who have been appointed unfairly may also be more likely to promote their own interests over the rights of the individual. Appointment procedures must therefore be transparent, fair and robust enough to ensure that only those candidates with the highest professional qualifications and standards of personal integrity are allowed to sit on the bench. Fair, independent and transparent appointment processes not only improve judicial independence, but also form part of a system of judicial accountability.",

When these features are missing, the sector’s integrity is eroded and corruption is given a fertile ground on which to flourish. In the case of water, corruption has become a driver of the sector’s crisis. Overuse and contamination, abetted by corruption, have caused water supplies to dwindle, user demands to surge and competition to increase for this indispensable resource. With increased water scarcity, corruption risks have risen throughout the sector. To counter these pressures, improved water governance is an essential element, but one that is often underfinanced or overlooked.",

         "excerpt":"“Integrity Pacts” are a tool developed by Transparency International for tackling corruption in public procurement. They have been applied in many countries around the world for over 20 years. There are even countries in which the use of the Integrity Pact has become part of the law or governmental procedures, such as in India or the “Social Witness” in Mexico. In other countries, the adoption of an Integrity Pact for specific public procurement projects is a result of strong advocacy efforts from civil society. Many guides, manuals and handbooks on the topic have been published. The most well-known is Integrity Pacts in Public Procurement: An Implementation Guide, which is a hands-on, practical guide designed to familiarise government officials in charge of public procurement processes with Integrity Pacts, and to provide them with the tools and ideas to apply them. This document will be referenced regularly throughout the present document. The purpose of this publication – which was written collaboratively in only four days – is to contribute to the already existing literature on Integrity Pacts, but from a civil society perspective. This document is based on the experience of the Transparency International global network. Representatives from 10 Transparency International chapters were brought together to review the challenges that are faced in the different stages of Integrity Pacts, and to document the alternatives they have found to overcome these challenges. These include challenges from the moment Integrity Pact implementation is being considered, until the time when the final results are evaluated. This guide does not intend to convince anyone of the usefulness of Integrity Pacts: rather, it is designed for those who are considering implementing, or have already decided to implement, an Integrity Pact. It is for those who are new to Integrity Pacts – who have questions about where, when and how to start implementing them.",

By perpetuating the ‘abuse of entrusted power for private gain’ – Transparency International’s (TI) definition of corruption – both the bribe payer and bribe taker cause damage in a number of ways. Ultimately, their corrupt dealings create extreme inequity – both in markets and in societies. This report presents highlights of a brand new survey commissioned by TI, the 2008 Bribe Payers Survey.1 It looks in detail at the sources of corruption in the international marketplace, both in terms of where the bribes are paid and by which businesses. Above all, the Bribe Payers Survey illustrates how the supply of corruption is viewed by a global selection of senior business executives, who understand the markets and market pressures in their own countries, some of which drive corruption.",

         "excerpt":"Transparency International (TI) has long held that the most damaging impact of corruption is the diversion of basic resources from poor people. Corruption in humanitarian aid is the most egregious form of this, as it deprives the most vulnerable poor people, the victims of natural disasters and civil conflicts, of essential life-saving resources. Humanitarian assistance aims to save lives and alleviate the suffering of people in times of crisis. Yet these noble ambitions do not immunise emergency responses from corrupt abuse. There were numerous examples of corruption during the massive Asian tsunami humanitarian response, and examples of substantial diversion of aid resources have been reported recently in Afghanistan, Iraq, Liberia and Somalia. In response to this concern, TI launched a programme in 2005 to diagnose corruption risks specific to humanitarian operations and to develop a set of good practices aimed at mitigating those risks. The first, diagnostic phase culminated in the publication of a report on Mapping the Risks of Corruption in Humanitarian Action, in 2006. We hope that this handbook will offer guidance and support to the many people in the humanitarian sector who devote their lives to alleviating the suffering of the most vulnerable people. The handbook is dedicated to their work, to their resilience and courage to support those who are most in need: the victims of natural disasters and civil conflict.",

         "excerpt":"The handbook is primarily aimed at managers and staff of humanitarian agencies, both at headquarters (HQ) and in the field. It speaks directly to those on front line of aid delivery as well as to senior managers who determine organisational culture and values. The handbook is designed to help anyone working in the humanitarian sector identify and prevent the corruption risks faced by their particular organisation or department, or within a specific programme or role. It does not try to set out industry-wide standards for aid agencies in emergencies. Rather, it describes ‘what to do’ to minimise corruption risks, while numerous reference documents attached offer technical details on ‘how to do it’. This is an abridged pocket version of the full guide.",

         "excerpt":"This report examines the practice of lobbying and the attempts to regulate it in 19 European countries and within the three core EU institutions. It comes at a time when public trust in government is at an all-time low and the practice of lobbying is widely associated with secrecy and unfair advantage. It also comes at a moment when an increasing number of governments in Europe are promising to tackle the problem of undue influence in politics, and the need for good government is particularly pressing given the range of economic, social and political challenges currently faced by European countries and EU institutions. Lobbying is an integral part of a healthy democracy, closely related to universal values such as freedom of speech and the right to petition of government. It allows for various interest groups to present their views on public decisions that may come to affect them. It also has the potential to enhance the quality of decision-making by providing channels for the input of expertise on increasingly technical issues to legislators and decision makers. Despite this, multiple scandals throughout Europe demonstrate that without clear and enforceable rules, a select number of voices with better resourcing and contacts can come to dominate political decision-making.

Public trust in the ability of institutions to deal with corruption is low and reporting channels are often unclear or unreliable.

This report provides examples of how Transparency International has worked with citizens to challenge the assumption that nothing can be done about corruption. Drawing primarily on the experience of seven European Union (EU) countries (the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg) participating in a multi-country project to empower citizens to speak up against corruption and wrongdoing, we highlight how we can work effectively with individuals to break the corruption cycle.",

In order to address the problem, Transparency International national chapters conducted in-depth research on the strengths and weaknesses of more than 60 institutions responsible for preventing and fighting corruption across the five countries.

Increasingly, hotlines are being valued as a channel for citizen redress and as a barometer of the success of government anti-corruption efforts. They provide for broad feedback to governments from civil society on how well policies and institutions are working, where breakdowns occur and where responses are needed. As a service, hotlines are similar to community audits and legal advice centres in offering a means to cross-check whether campaign pledges and government promises are producing results. Yet their success in combating corruption is dependent on a number of operational, administrative, institutional and political factors — each of which this paper will attempt to address by drawing on examples from Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Kenya and Moldova.",

The Global Corruption Report 2009 provides a platform for combining refl ections on practical experience with rigorous analysis and a forward-looking perspective on the reform of policy and practice.

It aims to identify gaps and shortcomings in political financing systems, with the objective of promoting transparency in political party funding. It is premised on the conviction that transparency is a prerequisite for monitoring money in politics. In the Western Balkans, the assessment carried out in 2010-2011 has focused on the annual, non-electoral funding of political parties in Albania, Croatia, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia and Serbia. All the countries under review have undergone important legislative and institutional changes in political financing in recent years. Further substantial legislative changes were introduced in 2011 in Albania, Croatia and Serbia. These new frameworks incorporate some of the provisions on improvement of supervision and disclosure, but have not been in place long enough to enable full assessment of their implementation. The regional report presents overall cross country findings of the research on regular funding of political parties and provides comparative analysis, as well as recommendations for addressing the identified shortcomings. More detailed information on evaluation of party financing systems is provided in individual country reports.",

Corruption makes water undrinkable, inaccessible and unaffordable. In developing countries, about 80 percent of health problems can be linked to substandard water and sanitation services, claiming the lives of nearly 1.8 million children every year. Corruption in water is skewing access to precious and scarce resources away from the citizens who need them most. It is hindering the water sector’s potential to serve as a catalyst for national development and instead has made water the source of stagnation in the lives of many. Every year, students suffering from water-related ailments around the world miss an estimated 443 million school days. For the poor, the loss of an education turns into lost opportunities for jobs, college and the future. The cycle of poverty becomes one that is increasingly difficult to break.",

This edition recognises that SMEs in many societies are frequently confronted with the problem of bribery. As smaller companies with limited resources SMEs face challenges in resisting and countering such pressures. Also, there are growing requirements made by large international companies for their suppliers to show evidence they have appropriate anti-bribery policies and systems in place. This edition aims to set out in a clear and direct manner the process by which smaller businesses can develop an anti-bribery programme relevant to their size and resources. Countering bribery is good business practice. It can help build reputation, especially with customers, and it can reduce risks. By building strong anti-bribery cultures SMEs can successfully challenge and resist bribery.",

Il report mostra come il Sistema di Integrità Nazionale italiano, con una valutazione media di appena 55,041, non possa essere considerato soddisfacente: in Italia la corruzione può infiltrarsi ovunque, considerato che molti settori cruciali dello Stato godono di ampia autonomia, alla quale non corrispondono standard adeguati di responsabilità e integrità.",

The overall picture in Latvia shows a general weakness in the party-political sphere and the business sector. The former is exemplified by the relatively low scores of political parties and the legislature. The latter manifests itself in the score of the business and, in part, also the media. Imperfect as they are, it is the executive and judiciary, which, together with the CPCB and the SAO, form the stronger part of the state apparatus.",

Italy's National Integrity System is far from robust, with an average NIS score of 55.04%. Corruption is able to flourish almost everywhere, as state institutions enjoy considerable autonomy, which does not correspond to standards of accountability and integrity. The report shows that it easy to circumvent mechanisms put in place to protect integrity by taking advantage of complex regulation, difficult access to information, and poor evaluation systems. Many governance institutions – in particular the Executive, Legislative and Judicial powers, as well as the Media – have been affected by conflict of interest.",

The Caribbean island has a population of 150,560 and is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It has gone through significant political change in recent years following dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 and the resulting modification of its country status. The purpose of these studies is to assess systemic corruption risks faced by a country, and produce a set of recommendations on how to mitigate those risks in the future. Those recommendations can then be used by actors in civil society, government and the private sector for promoting integrity in the country.",

The Global Corruption Barometer can be used to raise awareness of the extent and impact of corruption, as judged by the general public. Its question targeted at levels of corruption in institutions/sectors, for instance, can point to those areas with poor reputations that may be ripe for reform. TI, who commissioned the Global Corruption Barometer from Gallup International, first ran the Global Corruption Barometer in 2003. Country coverage was expanded considerably in 2004, from 48 to 64 countries, and TI will continue to increase the number of countries polled for the Barometer. Over time, TI expects the survey to convey important trends in the way the publics around the world regard corruption in their countries.",

It equips young citizens with the knowledge and skills to thrive in their country's economy and to participate fully in society. It is a cornerstone of economic and social development, a human right under international law and a constitutional guarantee in most countries. But in reality education is often characterised by poor quality and unequal access. For example, a region-wide survey of Africa’s education system showed more than 50 percent of respondents signalling numerous challenges to getting a basic education. Classroom overcrowding, poorly maintained primary schools, absent teachers, lack of textbooks and supplies, and unacceptably high fees and expenses were just some of the problems cited. When it comes to higher education, access in many countries depends more on the parents' purse and social status than the talent, effort and merit of the student. Unfortunately, corruption tends to be one of the principal reasons behind all of these problems.",

         "excerpt":"This set of three studies (Bangladesh, Peru and Ghana) explore countries’ experiences with advancing towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs are a set of goals aimed at making significant progress by 2015 on key development areas, including poverty, education and health. This study provides a window into how anti-corruption activities can positively support sustained advances in achieving the MDGs in Ghana. It demonstrates how civil society actors are working towards combating corruption in service delivery – a practice that severely compromises a country’s ability to provide basic services and meet the MDGs.",

         "excerpt":"Transparency International considers the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials to be a key building block in the international legal framework to combat corruption. Effective enforcement of the Convention would significantly reduce the supply side of international corruption as most major international companies have their headquarters in signatory states. TI and its national chapters have strongly promoted the adoption of the Convention, its ratification and the passage of implementing legislation by signatory states. TI has also participated actively in the OECD's follow-up monitoring program. This Progress Report approaches monitoring from a different perspective and presents a nongovernmental assessment of enforcement of the OECD Convention. It is based on information provided by TI national chapters in twenty-four OECD signatory states, which represent about ninety-five percent of OECD exports. Lawyers and other highly qualified professionals and academics were chosen by these national chapters as expert respondents to a TI questionnaire.",

Equally, when a political party resorts to paying for votes rather than focusing on the quality of its campaign message, democracy suffers.",

In accordance with this tradition, Finnish society functions in a formalrational manner. For the integrity system, this means that if there is legislation on a subject, it usually also works in practice.",

But all too often political party and campaign finance laws are breached with impunity, in the face of enforcement agencies that are constrained by cumbersome legislation, a lack of independence, insufficient resources or a lack of will. This situation needs remedying because people‘s trust in democracy is eroded when democratically elected leaders fail to comply with laws they themselves design.",

Forestry officials and law enforcement officers who are in the pockets of corrupt logging firms often turn a blind eye to activities that threaten the sustainable management of a forest’s biodiversity. Similarly, fishery inspectors endanger stocks when they accept bribes to ignore official quotas for trawlers. Within countries, poor governance may translate into sub-standard environmental policies, leaving interest groups to determine the common ‘environmental good’. In extreme cases, high-level political corruption can facilitate the wholesale plunder of a country’s natural resources. This paper looks at the current findings and discourse surrounding corruption in three renewable natural resources: forestry, fisheries and wildlife.",

The sixteen assessed pillars in the Slovak National Integrity System could be divided into two groups based on their performance: strong or weak pillars. Such division allows us to cluster the pillars into two sets of institutions possessing, in some extent, common features. Indicators of integrity and accountability in practice are very low in majority of pillars. This shows, together with the lack of independence in practice, that implementation of existing rules and legal frameworks are the major downsides of the NIS in Slovakia.",

Despite widespread calls for regulating lobbying activities, opaque rules remain the standard in many countries, causing lobbying activities to be veiled in secrecy. A recent study conducted by Transparency International in 25 European countries shows that only 6 have some form – in many cases minimal – of regulation over lobbying. Efforts are needed around Europe to lift the shroud off of lobbying through stronger controls and sanctions, mandatory lobbying registers, and regulation of the “revolving door” between the public and private sectors.",

Effects of such plans are an essential part of any political and especially preelection controversy. In the political debate and effort to formally meet European standards, it is often neglected that institutions of society and their anti-corruption potential are the key to longterm, sustainable and lasting fight against corruption. For this reason the NIS analysis is extremely important as an impartial expert assessment of the vulnerability of social institutions and their potential for combating corruption.

         "excerpt":"This is the first time a National Integrity System Assessment (NIS‐study) has been carried out in Norway. The purpose of the study is to promote awareness of the risk of corruption, vulnerability and risk management within important institutions in society. The overall assessment is that Norway’s integrity systems function well. All pillars achieve a total score of 82 or higher, which has to be considered as very good. However, even though the pillars score well or very well in terms of points, the study also uncovers weaknesses within most of the pillars. Some weaknesses are to be found in the legislation, while others are linked to practice. The extent and the severity of the weaknesses vary.",

The Corruption Perceptions Index measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption in countries worldwide. Based on expert opinion, countries are scored from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). Some countries score well, but no country scores a perfect 100. Two-thirds of the 176 countries ranked in the 2012 index score below 50, showing that public institutions need to be more transparent, and powerful officials more accountable.",
